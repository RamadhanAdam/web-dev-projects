## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of responsive design and CSS Flexbox. I also practiced using semantic HTML to improve accessibility. Here are some code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<figure class="figure">
  <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code linking to Frontend Mentor website" />
  <figcaption>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</figcaption>
  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</figure>
```

```css
.qrcode {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: white;
  margin: 100px auto;
  border-radius: 3%;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts and dive deeper into accessibility best practices. I also want to experiment with CSS animations and transitions to enhance user interactions.
